# Vintage Vinyl Shop — E-Commerce Simulation

This project is a front-end simulation of a small e-commerce website designed for practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The goal was not to create a fully polished interface, but to build the core logic of a shopping cart, dynamic price updates, and basic product interactions.

The website presents a fictional vinyl store where users can explore products, adjust quantities, add items to the cart, and calculate the total including shipping options and promotional discounts.

## Main Features

- **Product listing with images, titles, descriptions, and prices**
- **Interactive cart system**  
  Users can select quantity and add items, with totals updating dynamically.
- **Shipping options**  
  - Free shipping within the province  
  - Paid shipping outside the province  
- **Promotional discount button**  
  A fictional offer that applies a 50% reduction to the total.
- **Basic UX events**  
  Clicking on a product image pauses the automatic carousel.
- **Multi-page website structure**  
  Includes homepage, product page, and cart.
- **Fully client-side implementation** (no backend)

This project was developed with the purpose of learning how an e-commerce workflow can be structured on the front end.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — structure of the interface  
- **CSS3** — layout, spacing, colors, basic styling. The website is fully responsive, with layouts optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
A dedicated print stylesheet was also implemented to ensure clean formatting when users print the page. 
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — dynamic cart logic, quantity selection, discount function, UI interactions  
- **Images** — product previews for a realistic look. All product photos displayed in this project were shot and edited by me.

##  Learning Objectives

This project was built to practice:

- Creating interactive elements using JavaScript  
- Handling dynamic prices and totals  
- Building a simple user flow (browse → add → checkout)  
- Structuring a small multi-page website  
- Designing basic layouts and components without frameworks  

The graphic design is intentionally minimal and serves only as a foundation for practicing logic and layout.
